#

# Technologies used

> HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap, Jquery

# Direction for future development

> Would like to improve the functionality of it. To then go and schedule other days ahead of time, and to do that I would use a button that moves the day forward.

# Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
## Thanks for checking out my planner
